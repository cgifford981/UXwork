    <h2><strong>Laura Smith:</strong></h2>
    <p> On my first meeting with my group, we discussed what way the layout of the website was going to look like. We figured out who was better at different things and assigned them to complete that task. We decided to make our website based on Computer Science. I was given year 2 and the course overview section to complete. On our second meeting we went through the stuff we had done and checked to see if everything was running smoothly or if any of our team mates needed help or have any questions. I was then assigned with the making of the logo. I created a logo on photoshop by combining, cropping and altering two different pictures into the one. Each of us made our own Cv's using HTML and CSS and uploading them. Lastly, I then created a HTML document for our "About the Developer" page and wrote in my piece on how I contributed towards the website.</p>
	<p> Throughout my group work, I was unable to get any access onto Github to contribute any work. We made a group chat were we organised our group meetings and I sent over my work to Callum so he could upload it.</p>

    <p> There was 4 members apart of group 14 myself and Eve studying Business Information Systems and Callum studying Computer Science. We agreed to base our website around a computer science course in our first meeting then delegated each task to each member of the team to complete. I was tasked with the forms design, the year 4 page, the contact us page and my own CV. With the use of linking CSS to my Html i was able to create visually pleasing web pages with the use of the class function to design my pages on the CSS style sheet. On my Registration Form i decided to use white color on a navy background to make my h1 tag stand out to the user and used padding to tidy the title. I then set a light theme to my form with white textboxes to improve usability. The form was validated using HTML to ensure all fields were iputted correctly and the button was given a unique red colour to stand out and padding applied. Finally, i used a background image using the background image function URL to add a university theme image for the users to feel this is real.</p>

	<p>I used the github to communicate with the other team members such as Callum to add the header and footer to my web pages by pushing using the GitGUI application and allowed us to work off eachothers work remotley</p>

    <h2><strong>Callum Gifford</strong></h2>
    <p>My role within the team was to focus on the CSS across the website.  As a team we realised that it was critically important to have a consistent style and colour scheme across our website.  Within our group meetings we decided on a catchy but simple colour scheme that would engage users of the website and not make it difficult for them to read the text.  I was responsible for the layout of this colour scheme.  I also tested many different header and footers to see which suited our website the most and least.  I compared my work to other professional website to see how I could improve the style of the website further.  I was also responsible for the ‘Home-Page’, ‘Year 3’, connecting the main CSS page to every other page within the site and creating the header and footer which was a long process as I had to ensure they were not colliding with the code that my team members had wrote.  My CSS skills were also used again to develop a style for the ‘About Developers’ page and for my individual CV page.</p>

    <h2><strong>Eve Reynolds</strong></h2>
    <p>I contributed to the group project website by creating the html files for the staff and year one of the module pages. Once I completed the html content, I pushed it onto the git hub repository for other members of my group to make any changes necessary. We met regularly as a group and discussed and came to agreement for the overall layout of the website and what was going to be included in our header and footer along with content that we wanted included on each page, for example- action buttons to be placed in the same area on each page to ensure it had a professional look.</p>
